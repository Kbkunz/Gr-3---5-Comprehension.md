# Reluctant Readers in Elementary School

How can you encourage a child to read when it has always been difficult for them?  What are some concrete steps you can take to help them get over the road bump of their low confidence? 

> "There are many little ways to enlarge your child's world.  Love of books is best of all." - Jacqueline Kennedy

## Ideas to add to your routine:

1. Download books to play in your car.  
2. Read aloud an excellent series at night before bed.  *The Penderwicks, Percy Jackson*, or any Shannon Hale book.  
3. Buy a Kindle for your child and download books that are a just right level for them.  They can then hold tricky words to get their definition and pronunciation.  
4. Have your child read aloud a just right book to a pet or a younger sibling daily.  
5. Limit screen time and make books an easier and more accessible activity to grab.  

## Overcoming other obstacles:

**Embarrassment** In school, it may be helpful for your child to have a Kindle or other tablet to keep his or her books.  Sometimes students are embarrassed about their lower level book or book that is not a chapter book.  By having their books on tablets, other students will not be able to see the cover of the book and what your child is reading. 

**Book Boxes** Also make sure that your child's teacher has appropriately leveled books in their personal book box.  Asking the teacher to only use the Kindle would make that a lot easier.  

**Discussions**  Make sure you take time to discuss the books you are reading aloud to your child.  You are building their *schema* or background knowledge that will help their vocabulary and understanding of the world.  

**The Just Right Book** Has your child been given a "level" that is instructional?  Meaning are they able to read the text but still have some challenging words?  There are many types of assessment tools, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, and Lexile to name a few.  You can equate your child's assessment tool type to his/her Lexile level and then go to [Find A Book](https://hub.lexile.com/find-a-book/search) to find many books filtered by their just right level and genre.
